# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Fake-Review-Detection-System

Developed an end-to-end system for detecting fake (machine-generated) reviews and analyzing authentic reviews using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The system classifies reviews as genuine or fake, performs sentiment analysis on original reviews, categorizes them into positive, negative, or neutral, and converts sentiment scores into a 1.0â€“5.0 rating scale. Results are visualized through interactive graphs and pie charts for enhanced interpretability.

## Key Contributions:

Built a classification model to accurately detect fake reviews using text preprocessing and TF-IDF features.

Implemented sentiment analysis on genuine reviews using VADER and converted sentiment polarity into numeric ratings.

Filtered and categorized reviews to create structured outputs (positive, negative, neutral).

Visualized insights with Matplotlib/Seaborn (sentiment distribution, rating trends).
